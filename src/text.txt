------------------- Hello guys! -----------------------

This project is demo product about using ReactJS with Firebase.

I have used some services of Firebase such as: Google Auth Provider, Authentication, Cloud Firestore,...

Besides those things, I also have used universal-cookie npm package to save user's login information for next log in.

You can git clone this repo and customize it, it's up to you!!!

=>>> Happy coding
